# 3D Job-Finding-Universe

## Background
I created this website on my weekends and evenings during the Full-Stack Bootcamp.
Learing three.js was a great task for my spare time. The project was good for javascript training and helped my improve at coding in general.
It felt like **my own little hackatlon**. Me vs. the features I kept thinking of.
